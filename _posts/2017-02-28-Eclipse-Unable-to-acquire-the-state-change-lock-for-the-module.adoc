= Eclipse: Unable to acquire the state change lock for the module
:hp-tags: Eclipse, Error, Development, IDE

If you get the error: org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Unable to acquire the state change lock for the module: osgi.identity

That means you probably exited eclipse abruptly. 
To fix this, go to your workspace's .metadata (C:\Users\USERNAME\workspace\.metadata) and delete the .lock file.
