If your repository and development machines use different OS and git or your IDE shows everything as modified. You probably have a line ending issue.

Simply type the following command in your Git repository.

....
git config core.autocrlf false
....

Alternately you can edit your Git repo's config file.

....
nano .git/config
...
[core]
...
autocrlf = false
....

The next time you pull it should work normally.
