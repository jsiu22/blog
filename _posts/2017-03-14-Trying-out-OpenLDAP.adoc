This post's going to document my attempt with OpenLDAP.

I first started by getting code directly from http://www.openldap.org/software/download/[OpenLDAP].

It unpacked fine but when I tried to run `./configure`.
....
Configuring OpenLDAP 2.4.44-Release
...

configure: error: BDB/HDB: BerkeleyDB not available
....

Not a big problem, but then I realized I could just grab packaged copy.
....
1. sudo yum -y install openldap openldap-clients openldap-servers
