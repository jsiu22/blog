If you're using EGit and its showing 'Nothing to fetch' but you're sure your remote has updates. Try adding the following to your `.git/config` file under `[remote "remote_name"]`.

....
fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
....

This makes Git fetch all refs from your remote server starting at `refs/heads/` and store them under `refs/remotes/origin/` locally. It does so with all branches.
