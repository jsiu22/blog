I had a bit of trouble finding the init system used for a Linux box I was using. Since the init process is always assigned PID 1, you can use the proc virtual file system to access the init used. 

....
sudo /proc/1/exe --version
....

The output should be something like this:

....
exe (upstart 0.6.5)
...
....

or this:

....
systemd 231
...
....
